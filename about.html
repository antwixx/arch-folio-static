                    <p class="section-description">
                        At BR Design and Architecture, we started our partnership over 20 years ago in 2001 and have over 50 years of combined experience in the field of Architecture and Design. We can help with any project big or small and can take your project from schematic design through final construction phasing. From that home addition you've always dreamed of, to a new 30,000 square foot office build-out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        We specialize in commercial design, residential design, industrial design, and site planning. We always like to talk to our potential customers on the project site. It's important to not only discuss the project, but to go on location and see what the client sees. Many times we not only find another option, but often save our clients money by thinking outside the box or providing alternative options along with honest advice.
                    </p>
					<p class="section-description">
					Over the decades, we've maintained our core philosophy: architecture should be functional, beautiful, and sustainable. Every project we undertake reflects our dedication to these principles. We believe that great design emerges from understanding our clients' needs, respecting the environment, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Whether the client is a first-time home owner looking for an addition or one of our years-long existing business partners, we always stay committed to our values: excellence, collaboration, innovation, and integrity.
