                    <p class="section-description">
                        At BR Design and Architecture, we started our partnership over 20 years ago in 2001 and have over 50 years of combined experience in the field of Architecture and Design. We can help with any project big or small and can take your project from schematic design through final construction phasing. From that home addition you've always dreamed of, to a new 30,000 square foot office build-out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        We specialize in commercial design, residential design, industrial design, and site planning. We always like to talk to our potential customers on the project site. It's important to not only discuss the project, but to go on location and see what the client sees. Many times we not only find another option, but often save our clients money by thinking outside the box or providing alternative options along with honest advice.
                    </p>
					<p class="section-description">
					Over the decades, we've maintained our core philosophy: architecture should be functional, beautiful, and sustainable. Every project we undertake reflects our dedication to these principles. We believe that great design emerges from understanding our clients' needs, respecting the environment, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Whether the client is a first-time home owner looking for an addition or one of our years-long existing business partners, we always stay committed to our values: excellence, collaboration, innovation, and integrity.

                            Master Planning looks at what your final finished project will be when all phases and expansions are complete. We work with you to identify your needs over the life of the facility and then design for the complete project. Phasing and areas of future expansion are identified. This process includes a needs assessment analyzing what the organization will need in 5, 10, 20, and even 40 years. It also includes site evaluation services, land acquisition, and developing a Strategic Capital Facilities Plan that addresses the financial needs to support the development of the needed facilities.

                        <h3>Feasibility Studies</h3>
                        <p>
                            We believe that the best way to begin most building projects is by starting with a Feasibility Study where the main goal is to establish the best design solutions for the project so that you, the Client, feel totally confident that your requirements are understood and being met by the design. Some projects are more straightforward, however in many cases, the best design solution for a project does not materialize in a few minutes – it takes a little time to examine various options and ensure that the proposals made are feasible.

                            Through an established process that includes meetings, questionnaires, observations and interviews, we work with you to determine your needs, timeline and budget related to your project. We identify your current needs and plan for the needs 5, 10 and 20+ years into the future. By separating needs from wants and phasing the project to meet growth expectations, we develop a plan that is uniquely designed to work for you.

                        <p>
                            Choosing a site on which to locate a new property is not a simple task. Countless factors – natural, man-made, social and economic – must be examined. Where we choose to build and how we build on a site have an impact on the local and global environments, ongoing costs (utility bills, maintenance) and our physical and psychological well-being.
