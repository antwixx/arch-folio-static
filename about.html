                    <p class="section-description">
                        At BR Design and Architecture, we started our partnership over 20 years ago in 2001 and have over 50 years of combined experience in the field of Architecture and Design. We can help with any project big or small and can take your project from schematic design through final construction phasing. From that home addition you've always dreamed of, to a new 30,000 sf office build-out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        We specialize in commercial, residential, industrial, and site planning. We always like to talk to our potential customers on the project site. It's important to not only discuss the project, but to go on location and see what the client sees. A lot of times we not only find another option, but save our clients money as well by thinking outside the box or providing alternative options along with honest advice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        Feel free to give us a call with your next project. References are always available upon request. We view your project as our project.

                        <p>
                            Master Planning looks at what your final finished project will be when all phases and expansions are complete. We work with you to identify your needs over the life of the facility and then design for the complete project. Phasing and areas of future expansion are identified. This process includes a needs assessment analyzing what the organization will need in 5, 10, 20, and even 40 years. It also includes site evaluation services, land acquisition, and developing a Strategic Capital Facilities Plan that addresses the financial needs to support the development of the needed facilities.

Being a small firm allows us to work intimately with you as a person vs just another customer. Whether its a commercial project or a new home addition for your growing family, we are here to help. The process is simple: get the ideas and thoughts from mind to paper to the job site. Our plans are detailed and organized, resulting in accurate bidding and efficient construction.

                        <p>
                            We believe that the best way to begin most building projects is by starting with a Feasibility Study where the main goal is to establish the best design solutions for the project so that you, the Client, feel totally confident that your requirements are understood and being met by the design. Some projects are more straightforward, however in many cases, the best design solution for a project does not materialize in a few minutes – it takes a little time to examine various options and ensure that the proposals made are feasible.

We identify your current needs and plan for the needs 5, 10 and 20+ years into the future. By separating needs from wants and phasing the project to meet growth expectations, we develop a plan that is uniquely designed to work for you.

                            Choosing a site on which to locate a new property is not a simple task. Countless factors – natural, man-made, social and economic – must be examined. Where we choose to build and how we build on a site have an impact on the local and global environments, ongoing costs (utility bills, maintenance) and our physical and psychological well-being.

                            budget-conscious yet uncompromising in quality.
